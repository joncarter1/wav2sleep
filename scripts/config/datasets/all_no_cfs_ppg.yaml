# Dataset configuration excluding CFS and CCSHS
#
# CFS and CCSHS are excluded due to systematic PPG data quality issues:
#
# From diagnose_ppg_quality.py analysis:
#   - CFS:   median_mean = -0.382, z-score = 12.8, 100% outliers
#   - CCSHS: median_mean = -0.388, z-score = 13.0, 100% outliers
#   - MESA:  median_mean = +0.003, z-score = 0.0,  0% outliers (good)
#
# Both CFS and CCSHS have severe negative baseline offset affecting ALL recordings.
# This corrupts causal normalization's EMA baseline tracking.
#
# Usage:
#   uv run scripts/train.py model=wav2sleep causal=True datasets=all_no_cfs_ppg
